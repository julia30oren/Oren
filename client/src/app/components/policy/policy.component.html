            us of any changes to such personal information.</p>

        <h2>Information automatically collected</h2>
        <p>We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use or navigate the Website. This
            information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may
            include device and usage information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics,
            operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information
            about how and when you use our Website and other technical information. This information is primarily
            needed to maintain the security and operation of our Website, and for our internal analytics and
            reporting purposes.</p>
        <p>Like many businesses, we also collect information through cookies and similar technologies. The
            information we collect includes:</p>
        <ul class="tp-block-list">
            <li><strong>Log and Usage Data.</strong> Log and usage data is service-related, diagnostic, usage and
                performance information our servers automatically collect when you access or use our Website and
                which we record in log files. Depending on how you interact with us, this log data may include your
                IP address, device information, browser type and settings and information about your activity in the
                Website (such as the date/time stamps associated with your usage, pages and files viewed, searches
                and other actions you take such as which features you use), device event information (such as system
                activity, error reports (sometimes called ‘crash dumps’) and hardware settings).</li>
            <li><strong>Device Data.</strong> We collect device data such as information about your computer, phone,
                tablet
                or other device you use to access the Website. Depending on the device used, this device data may
                include information such as your IP address (or proxy server), device and application identification
                numbers, location, browser type, hardware model Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier,
                operating system and system configuration information.</li>
            <li><strong>Location Data.</strong> We collect location data such as information about your device’s
                location,
                which can be either precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and
                settings of the device you use to access the Website. For example, we may use GPS and other
                technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on your IP
                address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information either by refusing access to
                the information or by disabling your Location setting on your device. Note however, if you choose to
                opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the Services.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Information collected from other sources</h2>
        <p>In order to enhance our ability to provide relevant marketing, offers and services to you and update our
            records, we may obtain information about you from other sources, such as public databases, joint
            marketing partners, affiliate programs, data providers, social media platforms, as well as from other
            third parties. This information includes mailing addresses, job titles, email addresses, phone numbers,
            intent data (or user behavior data), Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, social media profiles, social
            media URLs and custom profiles, for purposes of targeted advertising and event promotion. If you
            interact with us on a social media platform using your social media account (e.g. Facebook or Twitter),
            we receive personal information about you such as your name, email address, and gender. Any personal
            information that we collect from your social media account depends on your social media account’s
            privacy settings.</p>

        <h2>COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES</h2>
        <p>We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store
            information. Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain
            cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice.</p>

        <h2>HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</h2>
        <p>Our Website offers you the ability to register and login using your third-party social media account
            details (like your Facebook or Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain
            profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may
            vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address,
            friends list, profile picture as well as other information you choose to make public on such social
            media platform.</p>
        <p>We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy notice or
            that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Website. Please note that we do not control, and
            are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media
            provider. We recommend that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use and
            share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.
        </p>

        <h2>YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
        <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in
            this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
            accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal
            information for longer than seventy two (72) months past the termination of the user’s account.</p>
        <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either
            delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal
            information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information
            and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
        <p>We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the
            security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure
            your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be
            guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other
            unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access,
            steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information,
            transmission of personal information to and from our Website is at your own risk. You should only access
            the Website within a secure environment.</p>
        <p>We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Website,
            you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and
            consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Website. If we learn that personal information from users
            less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable
            measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have
            collected from children under age 18, please contact us at <a rel="nofollow"

        <h2>Cookies and similar technologies</h2>
        <p>Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your
            browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this

        <h2>CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
        <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track
            (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about
            your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard
            for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to
            DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked
            online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform
            you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>
